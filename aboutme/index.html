    <p>Hello, my name is Micaela, I am getting my degree in software development. I worked to put my husband through school to avoid debt, and now I am going back to school to get my bachelors degree! I work two part time jobs and am very excited to start this new career in software development. My husband and I move around a lot, so BYU-Idaho has made it possible to go back to school wherever we move. </p>
