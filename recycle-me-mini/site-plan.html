        [Here at Recycle-Me-Mini, we encourage others to think outside the box, get creative with the items of clothing they currently have. Honestly, what's the risk? You want to try out a new hobby of sewing? You can find free or low cost fabric, go online and ask for ripped or stained clothing and test your hand at sewing. I started this business 99% free to me, including my sewing machine. Believe it or not, the only thing that I am consistently paying for is thread, button snaps, and new sewing needles when they inevitably break (after hours upon hours of sewing). I joined a facebook group that allows people to post things they no longer need for others to use. I was able to get both a sewing machine, and serger (this is what finishes the edge of clothing to avoid fraying). People often get rid of clothing, many people don’t know how to fix a hole and they pass along items in hopes that others can fix it up and make use of it. Why not try it? \n If you are ready to try your hand at recycling clothing, read our blog, click our links to our pinterest for pattern ideas, and styling ideas. Don’t know how to sew? Don’t have the time? Do you still want to keep clothing from the landfill? Visit our Instagram account to see things available to purchase, Etsy shop coming soon!]

      <h3>Why</h3>
      <p>
        [Why should we recycle our clothing? With a quick google search, you can see that around 92 million tonnes of clothing lands in the landfills each year, and that number has doubled in the past 20 years. How many times have you worn a hole through a pair of pants, shirts, or dresses that doesn’t really have an easy fix. Maybe it isn’t along a seam, maybe it’s an item that you loved or is sentimental in some way. Do you throw the whole item of clothing out? Oftentimes the answer is yes, there’s no reason to keep an item you can’t wear, but what if there was a way to prevent that all from going into the landfill? Well, good news,  There is! We may not always have the chance to wear it again ourselves, but we can pass along something to others in need.]

      </ul>
      <h3>How</h3>
      <p>
        [You can mix and match fabric, A large men’s shirt can be easily used to make a toddler dress,  and you already have a professional hem at the bottom, part of the job is done for you. My husband tends to rest his elbows on his desk as he works, this wears out his elbows incredibly fast, so I have a new shirt every few months to work with (we also buy used clothing which contributes to the speed at which things wear through). A cute patterned shirt or a flannel can be used to patch holes in kids clothing, You can use scraps from sleeves to make hair bows or ties for special occasions. Take two complimentary prints and put them together to have a fun dress with one pattern on top for the bodice and a different one for the skirt. At your local craft stores, you can often find baby and children’s clothing patterns for under $10, you can find free tutorials online on how to make your own pattern. You can take an item of clothing that your child already has and estimate the size for your own pattern, the possibilities are endless as you use a little bit of imagination! Use the cuffs of the shirt as flutter sleeves. Do you want your child to have matching ties, bows, or dresses to you? Find a matching item of clothing, a complimentary pattern or color and take an hour (or more) to create something new.]
