                    <p>To educate and explore ways to recycle used clothing into kids clothing. We often wear a hole in the inner thighs, knees, elbows, etc or spill something and stain the edge of a blouse. While they arenâ€™t always appropriate to wear with those things, the rest of the item of clothing is perfectly fine. All of that would go into landfills, at Recycle-Me-Mini, we want to prevent some of that fabric from going to waste, we use whatever fabric that is usable and turn it into one of a kind outfits for babies through about 4 years old. If you are wanting to feel good about where you purchase clothing and want a unique outfit for your littles. </p>

                <section class="Audience">
                    <p>Our audience is anybody who wants to feel good about the clothing you buy or make. Ages newborn to around 4T can have a one of a kind, unique outfit, while keeping things out of the landfill.  </p>
