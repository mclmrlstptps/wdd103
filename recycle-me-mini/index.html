                    <p>
                        Recycle-Me-Mini was a dream I have had for the last four years. It all started with a single denim skirt. I borrowed my brother-in-law's sewing machine, took an old ripped, stained pair of pants trying to just remember how to sew a few basic stitches. That skirt was made using the basic sizing of clothing borrowed from my niece, to estimate the size. The sewing machine remained untouched for a two years while I dreamed about making this into a business, I saw a facebook posting for a free serger, which gave me a start to Recycle-Me-Mini! Two years later, here we are! I have a sewing machine (also received free) and a few patterns for outfits that I now make. I have freehanded a few more dresses as well as hair bows. In total, this business took less than $100 to start up, and I hope to make it somewhat successful in the future! I am so glad you are here, I am currently working to create an instagram, etsy, and facebook page if you would like to join in the future!

                    <h1>Purpose</h1>
                    <p>To educate and explore ways to recycle used clothing into kids clothing. We often wear a hole in the inner thighs, knees, elbows, etc or spill something and stain the edge of a blouse. While they arenâ€™t always appropriate to wear with those things, the rest of the item of clothing is perfectly fine. All of that would go into landfills, at Recycle-Me-Mini, we want to prevent some of that fabric from going to waste, we use whatever fabric that is usable and turn it into one of a kind outfits for babies through about 4 years old. If you are wanting to feel good about where you purchase clothing and want a unique outfit for your littles. </p>
